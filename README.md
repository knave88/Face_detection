Face Detection and alignment in unconstrained environment are challenging due to various poses, illuminations, and occlusions.

Face Verification task depicts a 1:1 classification where the image of the subject is compared to a pre-exisiting image of the person.

Topics included in this DEMO:
* Face detection with Haar Cascade Classifier (OpenCV) 
* Face detection with Deep Learning MTCNN (Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Networks) model
* Face detection on photograph and camera stream
* Face verification with VGGFace2 and DeepFace
